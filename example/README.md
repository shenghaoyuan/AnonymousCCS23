# Overview
This folder provides some rBPF examples, where:
- `*.bin`: the binary file generated by llvm eBPF + rBPF pre-process
- `*.c`: The C program that translates binary files into Coq int64 format
- `*.txt`: The output of the C program
- `*.v`: The final Coq test example
- `*.ml`: it is automically extracted from `*.v` firstly and then some repatches and print functions are manually inserted.

# Repatch step:
- **remove**
1. remove 'type int = int'

- **replace**
1. 'Pervasives.' -> 'Stdlib.'

- **add**
1. 'print_*'
